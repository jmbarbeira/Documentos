The new generation of Handpoint APIs and SDKs are engineered to make your life simpler, happier.  
  
**Awesomely simple**  
Created for humans, coders, geeks, no need of dark and complex knowledge of the payment industry.  

**Superly secure**  
We take care of the PCI side so you don't have to spend months becoming compliant.  
The Handpoint card reader encrypts all sensitive cardholder data so your app does not have to deal with it.  

**Working with the SDK**
The Handpoint Android SDK is compatible with Android version 4.0.3 (API level 15) and up.  
Latest version is compiled with java 1.7.0_25.  
 1. Download the SDK.  
 2. Import the SDK to your project. 
 3. Follow the getting started guide, to get you up and running or dive into the documentation.  
  
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us.  
Note about reconnections: By default, the SDK will automatically reconnect to the last known device when the connection is lost. If you want to change this behaviour set the property Settings.AutomaticReconnection in HapiManager to false.  
version 4.4.2
